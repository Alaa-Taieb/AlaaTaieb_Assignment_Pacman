# AlaaTaieb_Assignment_Pacman :video_game:

Welcome to my browser-based Pacman game! :joystick: This game is an assignment that I was given at Coding Dojo Bootcamp. It is developed using HTML, Javascript, and CSS, and it includes a player character that can move and collect coins, as well as ghosts that spawn randomly on the board. 

## Features
- Player character that can move and collect coins :video_game:
- Randomly spawning ghosts :ghost:
- Future plan to include pathfinding for ghosts :construction:
